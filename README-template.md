## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was reminded that HTML and CSS should not be intermingled in the same file. It's for clarity on both sides and with possible collaborators that it remains separated. I also learned that I prefer spacing especially different elements in HTML.

Linking my CSS within my HTML seems to be my most forgettable step when setting up my HTML boilerplate. However, I'm proud that I've come to like the CSS selectors with @; they used to seem intimidating to me when I started learning.


```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```
```css
@media (min-width: 500px) {
    .container {
        width: 400px;
    }
}
```
